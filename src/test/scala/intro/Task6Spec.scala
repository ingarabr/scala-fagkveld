/**
  * This is a bonus task that I don't expect you to be done with.
  *
  * In this task I want you to create a binary tree structure.
  * A binary tree is a node with two child nodes. A child node can
  * have two states, it can be empty or it can hold a value.
  * Each child node can hold two more child nodes nodes.
  *
  * You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree
  *
  * The task is to create a binary tree that have the following
  * properties:
  *
  * - Support Int
  * - Pattern matching on nodes
  * - Be immutable
  *
  * Bonus tasks:
  * - Support custom types
  * - Adding elements to the tree
  * - Rebalancing the binary tree.
